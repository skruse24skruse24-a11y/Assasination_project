His reign was marked by religious controversy as he attempted to replace Jupiter with Elagabalus as Rome\'s chief deity, and by scandalous behavior that offended Roman sensibilities. By 222 CE, his grandmother Julia Maesa decided he had become a liability and orchestrated a conspiracy to replace him with his cousin Alexander Severus.

However, they distrusted each other and failed to work together effectively. The Praetorian Guard, angry at being excluded from the selection process and receiving no bonus payment, resented both emperors.

Rush represented Florence County in the state legislature and was active in organizing Black voters and supporting civil rights. The 1876 election year was particularly violent in South Carolina, with white supremacist "Red Shirts" paramilitary groups terrorizing Black voters and Republican politicians. On October 16, 1876, Rush and his wife Aggy were returning home from a Republican campaign picnic when they stopped at a creek crossing to let their horses drink. A gunshot rang out from ambush, striking Rush directly in the heart and killing him instantly. William D. Purvis, a white neighbor, was arrested and tried for the assassination, but an all-white jury acquitted him despite evidence. Rush\'s murder was one of many political assassinations during the 1876 campaign that ended Reconstruction through terror.</div>', 'Alfred Rush'],

On July 2, 1881, just four months into his presidency, Garfield was shot at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station in Washington, D.C. by Charles J. Guiteau, a disgruntled office seeker who believed he deserved a political appointment. Guiteau shot Garfield twice in the back as the president waited for a train. One bullet grazed his arm, but the other lodged near his spine. Garfield survived the initial shooting but lingered for 79 days in excruciating pain. His condition was worsened by his doctors\' repeated probing of the wound with unsterilized instruments, causing infections. He died on September 19, 1881 at a seaside cottage in Elberon, New Jersey, where he had been moved to escape Washington\'s summer heat. The cause of death was blood poisoning and infection, largely due to unsanitary medical practices. Guiteau was convicted and hanged on June 30, 1882.</div>', 'James Garfield'],

On May 21, 1991, while campaigning for the Congress Party in Tamil Nadu during India\'s general election, Gandhi was assassinated by a female suicide bomber named Thenmozhi Rajaratnam, a member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). At 10:10 PM, as Gandhi approached supporters at a rally in Sriperumbudur, the bomber bent down as if to touch his feet (a traditional gesture of respect), then detonated an RDX explosive belt. The blast killed Gandhi instantly along with 14 others, including the bomber and several police officers. The assassination was orchestrated by LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran in retaliation for Gandhi\'s decision to send Indian peacekeeping forces to Sri Lanka in 1987, which had opposed the Tamil Tigers. Gandhi\'s death shocked India and the world, as he was seen as a modernizing force and potential leader who could bridge India\'s future. His assassination effectively ended the Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty\'s direct leadership of India. The investigation led to the conviction of 26 conspirators, though the case remained politically sensitive for decades.</div>', 'Rajiv Gandhi'],

On May 2, 2011, at approximately 1:00 AM local time, U.S. Navy SEAL Team Six launched "Operation Neptune Spear," a targeted raid on the compound. The SEALs breached the compound, engaged in firefights with bin Laden\'s bodyguards, and ultimately cornered bin Laden on the third floor of the main building. SEAL Team member Robert O\'Neill shot and killed bin Laden with multiple rounds to the chest and head. The operation lasted about 40 minutes. Bin Laden\'s body was identified through DNA testing and buried at sea within 24 hours according to Islamic tradition. President Barack Obama announced the successful mission to the world, declaring "justice has been done."
